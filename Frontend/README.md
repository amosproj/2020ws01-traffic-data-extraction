# Front-End Project

This project provides a user interface for the **Traffic Data Visualization and Extraction** project by the AMOS Team 1 in WS20/21.

## Requirements

For development, you will need `node` and `npm` installed. Since we are using the **VueJS Framework**, you will also need to install `Vue` and the design framework for Vue `Vuetify`.

For the visualization of the traffic data on a map, we use `OpenStreetMap` and the JavaScript library `Leaflet`.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

## Tests

```bash
# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests 
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

Coverage will be displayed in the console or you can find a full report under `test\unit\coverage\index.html`
